    "`Assister discovery` is a software that maps user requests to executable commands in [Assister Pipeline](https://github.com/keyvan-m-sadeghi/assister/tree/assister-conception/rfcs/text/assister-conception#assister-pipeline), illustrated in the following figure. Using [Natural Language Understanding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_understanding) coupled with Machine Learning over the [Terms and Functions](https://github.com/keyvan-m-sadeghi/assister/tree/assister-conception/rfcs/text/assister-conception#terms-and-functions-language-tfx) contextual annotations embedded in an application, a discovery can translate a request to the corresponding command. The command will then be executed within the Pipeline. [[Link to the full proposal]](https://github.com/keyvan-m-sadeghi/assister/tree/assister-conception/rfcs/text/assister-conception)\n",
